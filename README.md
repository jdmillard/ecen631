Introduction
---
This repo contains the relevant files for my robotic vision class. Each assignment is considered a project folder which can be compiled in the respective build directories using Cmake.

Notes
---
 * OpenCV 3.1; I used packages included with ROS Kinetic.
 * Some assignments require a webcam.
