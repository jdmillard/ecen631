Build and Run
---
This assignment demonstrates camera calibration.


From the build directory, these commands should build and run a given assignment:
```
$ cmake .. && make    # build
$ ./assignment        # run
```

Notes
---
 * I'm now using my laptop webcam but the notes below still may be useful.
 * The webcam I used worked in the lab, but not at home. I was getting `VIDEOIO ERROR: V4L2: Pixel format of incoming image is unsupported by OpenCV` How I made it work:
    * Install video for linux: `$ sudo apt-get install v4l2ucp`
    * Create environment variable: `export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libv4l/v4l2convert.so` (always run for new terminals or add to .bashrc)
        * This [thread](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/programming-9/opencv-pixel-format-of-incoming-image-is-unsupported-by-opencv-842801/) was helpful, but my *.so path was different
        * To find your proper *.so path, use `locate v4l | grep -v 0 | grep convert`
        * Running `$ v4l2ucp` will open a configuration gui, but I didn't need it.
 * Some additional [good coding ideas](http://answers.opencv.org/question/42508/videoio-error-pixel-format-unsupported/)
